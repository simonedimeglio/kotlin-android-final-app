The way the app was designed and built, it allows for a wide range of upgrades and features. This is the list of what we thought:

 - [ ] Sharing quiz via link 
 - [ ] Many languages - Allow access to the app by selecting the language
 - [ ] Create a premium (paid) profile for the quiz creator for additional features
 - [ ] Timer on quiz
 - [ ] Ability to participate @ public quizzes (created by unknown users)
 - [ ] App customization through themes
 - [ ] Instant refresh when adding questions and editing them

> Given the choice of RAD methodology, commit is done only if there are
> no errors in the code and if everything is duly commented. Code review
> is needed: first, everyone makes mistakes and second, everyone can
> find them. Make sure you don't distribute any code that hasn't been
> read by at least one person other than the dev who wrote it
> (preferably by multiple devs together).
> 
> The comment or each block of comments must always be signed by the
> initials of the dev as in the following example (s for Simone, f for
> Filippo, j for Jasmine, g for Giulia)

>     // Lorem Ipsum - S

 1. Each commit will have to present the name of the dev and describe
    what has been done

2. The names of the variables, constants and functions will be written in English and will be descriptive names

3. The names of variables, constants and functions will be written in camelCase

4. Boolean variables for controls will have the following nomenclature: checkNameOfControl

5. Document your code at the end of each workday

<br/>

- Frequent meetings are planned to check the progress of the code.
- Quality and functionality are in the foreground: better less, but done well.
- Asking for help is not a crime.
- The code belongs to the team, the result belongs to the team, the problems belong to the team.
- Write code that everyone can read, even devs outside the group. If you don't understand, edit.
